# Pseudo_HTML_Compiler_Cpp
Using the concepts of Stacks and queues I have implemented an html like parser that checks for the opening and closing of necessary brackets and using Least recent unit concept to ensure whether a certain file is written correctly or not and then performs the tasks specified in each of these files which includes prefix, postfix, numerical functions and reading of images.The reading of images is performed by using the openCV library which you can use the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trXs2r6xSnI&t=2s to install and use the necessary functions used in the project. The images used in the project file as well as the test files and output folder have been uploaded for use.
